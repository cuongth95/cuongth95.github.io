My current PhD research, funded by the Dutch Research Council (NWO), focuses on developing data-driven Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to enhance decision-making in Digital Twin systems for Water Distribution Networks, under the supervision of Assistant Professor Victoria Degeler (University of Amsterdam) and Professor Alexander Lazovik (RuG). Before PhD, I graduated Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence at University of Maastricht, the Netherlands. As a Deep Learning Enthusiast , my research interests center on Neural Networks, especially for GNNs, Self-supervised Learning, Test-Time Training, and ML applications.
